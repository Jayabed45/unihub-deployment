It is projected by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that by 2050, if nothing is done to mitigate global warming, coastal lands at sea level will be flooded by seawaters to a height of two to three meters. Global warming will also devastate communities located at higher elevations through extreme weather events – storms, floods, prolonged droughts.\nThe greatest human-caused contributor to global warming are the emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from coal-fueled power plants. During the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, the member countries of the UNFCCC, consisting of almost 200 members, including the Philippines, committed to “phase out” (or “phase down”, the term preferred by India and China) of the coal power plants operating within their borders. Throughout the Philippines, around 80 to 90 percent of consumption of electricity is supplied by coal-fueled power plants. \nUnder the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines has committed “to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent from its 2015 levels by the year 2030”. Electricity Decarbonization Programs are being carried out by communities in the public and private sectors of the Philippines, such as consumer groups, subdivisions, and barangays, as their primary response to counter the threat of global warming. (The Electricity Decarbonization Programs were initially formulated in February 2022 for groups of consumers residing within a common compound, but the MCPC found the EDPs appropriate for implementation by larger communities, such as subdivisions and barangays.) \nThe particular objective of EDPs is the displacement of electric power supply from coal-fueled power plants by power supply from renewable energy resources. The goal of consumer groups carrying out EDPs is to gradually transfer power supply from expensive coal power plants to cheaper renewable energy power systems so that, by 2030 or earlier, 100% of consumption of electricity by the community will come from renewable energy resources. \nElectricity Decarbonization Programs are being carried out in two stages: The first is the construction of “community-shared” solar power systems within consumer compounds, subdivisions, or barangays, to supply up to 30% of the electricity requirements of the community. The generation of community-shared solar power systems, which are usually installed on the rooftops of buildings, will be shared among the consumers located within a distinct area and connected to a common portion of the distribution system. Community-shared solar power systems is an innovation from individually-owned solar systems, whose generation is consumed only by the single customer who owns the solar power system. The second stage of the EDPs is the purchase from, or the development of, community-owned hydroelectric power plants, biomass power plants, and other renewable energy resources (also known as Distributed Generation), to displace the remaining balance of electricity consumption that coal power plants are still supplying after the solar power systems are constructed within the community. \n\"></textarea></section><section class=\"space-y-2\"><h4 class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">B. Relevance of Need</h4><textarea class=\"w-full rounded-lg border border-yellow-200 bg-white px-3 py-2 text-sm text-gray-900 focus:border-yellow-400 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-yellow-200 min-h-[180px]\" placeholder=\"Justify why the institution must respond to this need at this time.\" value=\"In the first stage, community-shared solar power systems will be constructed in open spaces or installed on rooftops of buildings within the community, under the Net-Metering system established by the Department of Energy in accordance with the Renewable Energy Law of 2008, a.k.a. Republic Act No. 9513. (Prior to the development of community-shared solar power systems, the only net-metering projects that have been implemented in the Philippines are for single buildings whose generation is consumed within the building rather than shared with other buildings within a distinct area.) \nThe solar power systems within the community will supply only up to 30% of the annual consumption of electric energy by the community, while the bulk of the power supply will come from the distribution system of the local distribution utility company or electric cooperative. (Note that the community will remain connected to the distribution system of the electric cooperatives or investor-owned distribution utilities like CEBECO.) Since electricity from solar power systems located within the community are cheaper than power supply from coal power plants during daytime hours, the consumers will see a reduction in the costs that they are paying for their monthly consumption of electricity. The reduction in rates will be slight (because the solar power systems provide only up to 30% of the electricity requirements), but the reduction is significant in the consumption of electricity from coal power plants. The solar power systems within the communities can be developed independently by the communities, and, in the case of the barangays, the barangay LGU can borrow the funds needed to construct the solar power system, and engage the technical experts needed to carry out the construction and operation and maintenance of the solar power systems. However, because the communities cannot raise the required investments and do not have internal expertise to carry out the solar power projects, the projects are usually developed by the communities using external funds (rather than investments by people within the community), and in partnership with private corporations, usually under 15-years build-operate-and transfer (BOT) terms in which the solar systems are transferred free of charge to the community after 15 years of cooperation period. The second stage of the EDPs is the purchase of electricity (through consumer choice, under the system of Retail Competition and Open Access, RCOA, of the EPIRA) from community-owned micro- or mini-hydroelectric power plants, each of which has capacity of 250 kilowatts to 5,000 kW (larger hydro plants are usually environmentally-destructive, and so are avoided), and other distributed generation resources, such as biomass or small wind (up to 1,000 kW), that will displace power supply from coal power plants. The community-owned hydropower plants are still being developed and will become available starting in 2025. \nThe end result of Electricity Decarbonization Programs carried out by consumer groups, subdivision homeowners associations, or barangay LGUs, is that communities of consumers of electricity throughout the Philippines will be able to obtain 100% of their power supply from renewable energy resources, by the year 2030 or earlier, at rates lower by at least two pesos per kilowatt-hour compared with power supply from coal-fueled power plants; whereas consumers are now getting 80 to 100% of their power supply from expensive coal power plants that poison the local environment and cause global warming.\n\n\n\"></textarea></section><section class=\"space-y-2\"><h4 class=\"text-sm font-semibold text-gray-900\">C.

MCPC Founder and then Vice President of CEPALCO, Engr. David Tauli, initiated the advocacy of harnessing solar energy as a source of renewable energy, which greatly helped small communities become aware of the advantages of using green energy and the ill effects of climate change brought about by the continuous burning of fossil fuels, etc. After Typhoon Odette made rather horrific damage to parts of the Visayas, the coalition decided to expand its advocacy to small communities in the region. One of these communities identified as a potential pilot group is the AFACO which was just recently accredited by the CDA.\nUnfortunately, the homeowners lack awareness of renewable energy and should therefore first undergo contextualized training in order to be equipped with the needed knowledge and skills to become recipients of the MCPC project. A focus group discussion with the homeowners revealed that at least 90% of them are consciously recording their increasing electricity bill but that they are not aware of possible mitigation measures except to minimize use which to them are often not doable given that most of the household equipment is run by electricity coupled with the transition to blended learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"></textarea><div class=\"space-y-2\"><p class=\"text-sm font-medium text-gray-900\">The table below shows a snapshot of the FGD:</p><p class=\"text-sm text-gray-600\">Number of

          "value": "Because of its potentially catastrophic consequences, global warming is the greatest threat to the long-term economic well-being of communities in coastal areas. It is projected by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that by 2050, if nothing is done to mitigate global warming, coastal lands at sea level will be flooded by seawaters to a height of two to three meters. Global warming will also devastate communities located at higher elevations through extreme weather events – storms, floods, prolonged droughts.\nThe greatest human-caused contributor to global warming are the emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from coal-fueled power plants. During the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021, the member countries of the UNFCCC, consisting of almost 200 members, including the Philippines, committed to “phase out” (or “phase down”, the term preferred by India and China) of the coal power plants operating within their borders. Throughout the Philippines, around 80 to 90 percent of consumption of electricity is supplied by coal-fueled power plants. \nUnder the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2015, the Government of the Republic of the Philippines has committed “to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent from its 2015 levels by the year 2030”. Electricity Decarbonization Programs are being carried out by communities in the public and private sectors of the Philippines, such as consumer groups, subdivisions, and barangays, as their primary response to counter the threat of global warming. (The Electricity Decarbonization Programs were initially formulated in February 2022 for groups of consumers residing within a common compound, but the MCPC found the EDPs appropriate for implementation by larger communities, such as subdivisions and barangays.) \nThe particular objective of EDPs is the displacement of electric power supply from coal-fueled power plants by power supply from renewable energy resources. The goal of consumer groups carrying out EDPs is to gradually transfer power supply from expensive coal power plants to cheaper renewable energy power systems so that, by 2030 or earlier, 100% of consumption of electricity by the community will come from renewable energy resources. \nElectricity Decarbonization Programs are being carried out in two stages: The first is the construction of “community-shared” solar power systems within consumer compounds, subdivisions, or barangays, to supply up to 30% of the electricity requirements of the community. The generation of community-shared solar power systems, which are usually installed on the rooftops of buildings, will be shared among the consumers located within a distinct area and connected to a common portion of the distribution system. Community-shared solar power systems is an innovation from individually-owned solar systems, whose generation is consumed only by the single customer who owns the solar power system. The second stage of the EDPs is the purchase from, or the development of, community-owned hydroelectric power plants, biomass power plants, and other renewable energy resources (also known as Distributed Generation), to displace the remaining balance of electricity consumption that coal power plants are still supplying after the solar power systems are constructed within the community. \n"

          "value": "In the first stage, community-shared solar power systems will be constructed in open spaces or installed on rooftops of buildings within the community, under the Net-Metering system established by the Department of Energy in accordance with the Renewable Energy Law of 2008, a.k.a. Republic Act No. 9513. (Prior to the development of community-shared solar power systems, the only net-metering projects that have been implemented in the Philippines are for single buildings whose generation is consumed within the building rather than shared with other buildings within a distinct area.) \nThe solar power systems within the community will supply only up to 30% of the annual consumption of electric energy by the community, while the bulk of the power supply will come from the distribution system of the local distribution utility company or electric cooperative. (Note that the community will remain connected to the distribution system of the electric cooperatives or investor-owned distribution utilities like CEBECO.) Since electricity from solar power systems located within the community are cheaper than power supply from coal power plants during daytime hours, the consumers will see a reduction in the costs that they are paying for their monthly consumption of electricity. The reduction in rates will be slight (because the solar power systems provide only up to 30% of the electricity requirements), but the reduction is significant in the consumption of electricity from coal power plants. The solar power systems within the communities can be developed independently by the communities, and, in the case of the barangays, the barangay LGU can borrow the funds needed to construct the solar power system, and engage the technical experts needed to carry out the construction and operation and maintenance of the solar power systems. However, because the communities cannot raise the required investments and do not have internal expertise to carry out the solar power projects, the projects are usually developed by the communities using external funds (rather than investments by people within the community), and in partnership with private corporations, usually under 15-years build-operate-and transfer (BOT) terms in which the solar systems are transferred free of charge to the community after 15 years of cooperation period. The second stage of the EDPs is the purchase of electricity (through consumer choice, under the system of Retail Competition and Open Access, RCOA, of the EPIRA) from community-owned micro- or mini-hydroelectric power plants, each of which has capacity of 250 kilowatts to 5,000 kW (larger hydro plants are usually environmentally-destructive, and so are avoided), and other distributed generation resources, such as biomass or small wind (up to 1,000 kW), that will displace power supply from coal power plants. The community-owned hydropower plants are still being developed and will become available starting in 2025. \nThe end result of Electricity Decarbonization Programs carried out by consumer groups, subdivision homeowners associations, or barangay LGUs, is that communities of consumers of electricity throughout the Philippines will be able to obtain 100% of their power supply from renewable energy resources, by the year 2030 or earlier, at rates lower by at least two pesos per kilowatt-hour compared with power supply from coal-fueled power plants; whereas consumers are now getting 80 to 100% of their power supply from expensive coal power plants that poison the local environment and cause global warming.\n\n\n"

They had been identified as one of the communities to submit applications as recipients of the EDP project of the partnership between Mindanao Coalition of Power Consumers and Arise Christian Ministries Inc. Foundation, who are looking to expand their community projects in the Visayas after the onslaught of Typhoon Odette.\n\tIn order to compose their application, the group requested assistance from CTU Tuburan Campus as they are quite unfamiliar with renewable energy, which is the primary focus of the project.\n\tFrom among the 318 households in the barangay, 70 homeowners volunteered to be interviewed relevant to electricity decarbonization. From these homeowners, 20 were chosen based on their willingness to pursue electricity decarbonization and also considering the feasibility of solar panel installation on a south-facing portion of their house.\n\t\n"

          "value": "The Mindanao Coalition of Power Consumers has been implementing electricity decarbonization projects around Mindanao since Typhoon Sendong badly hit Northern Mindanao in 2012. MCPC Founder and then Vice President of CEPALCO, Engr. David Tauli, initiated the advocacy of harnessing solar energy as a source of renewable energy, which greatly helped small communities become aware of the advantages of using green energy and the ill effects of climate change brought about by the continuous burning of fossil fuels, etc. After Typhoon Odette made rather horrific damage to parts of the Visayas, the coalition decided to expand its advocacy to small communities in the region. One of these communities identified as a potential pilot group is the AFACO which was just recently accredited by the CDA.\nUnfortunately, the homeowners lack awareness of renewable energy and should therefore first undergo contextualized training in order to be equipped with the needed knowledge and skills to become recipients of the MCPC project. A focus group discussion with the homeowners revealed that at least 90% of them are consciously recording their increasing electricity bill but that they are not aware of possible mitigation measures except to minimize use which to them are often not doable given that most of the household equipment is run by electricity coupled with the transition to blended learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n"
